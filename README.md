## 😫 The Problem
You are watching a lecture or tutorial in **Full Screen**. You need to save a formula, a slide, or a memory.
1. You press **Print Screen**.
2. The video minimizes, or the "Pause" overlay appears and blocks the text.
3. You have to open Paint/Snipping Tool to crop out the browser tabs and taskbar.

## 😎 The Solution: AltCap
**AltCap** grabs the raw video frame with a single keystroke.
1. You press **Alt**.
2. **Done.**

The clean image is instantly saved to your downloads.

## 🎯 Perfect For...
*   **Students:** Snap formulas and slides on Udemy/Coursera instantly for last-minute revision.
*   **Memories:** Save high-quality (HQ) moments from vlogs or music videos.
*   **Clean Capture:** Gets the video only. No mouse cursor, no play bar, no window borders.

## ⚠️ Important: "Black Screen" Fix (Udemy/Netflix)
If your screenshots come out **Black**, it is because of Chrome's Hardware Acceleration (DRM protection).
To fix this (required for sites like Udemy):
1. Click the **3 Dots** in the top right of Chrome.
2. Go to **Settings**.
3. Click **System** on the left menu.
4. **Turn OFF** "Use graphics acceleration when available".
5. Relaunch Chrome.
